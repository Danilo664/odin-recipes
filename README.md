Recipes for delicious stuff

I added img folder in which are pictures , which are used for recipes
everyting is working fine and im proud of what i learned, despite this being the begining 

I added Go Back button , so that you can come back to index page

Also might make some of my recipes myself

Edit: didnt know git commit will add comment to every single file/folder
