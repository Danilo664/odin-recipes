                <li>2 cups brown sugar</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons prepared yellow mustard, or as needed</li>

                <li>Score ham by making 1/2-inch deep diagonal cuts, creating a diamond pattern; transfer ham to a roasting pan.</li>
                <li>Mix brown sugar with enough yellow mustard to make a smooth, pourable sauce.</li>
                <li>Pour reserved pineapple juice over ham, followed by the honey.</li>
                <li>Pour brown sugar mixture over honey and arrange pineapple rings decoratively atop ham.
                    Secure pineapple rings with toothpicks.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until diamond pattern on ham splits open, 1 to 1 1/2 hours.
                    Baste ham every 15 minutes with pan drippings.</li>
